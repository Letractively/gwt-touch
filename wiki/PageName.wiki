#summary Project Overview

= Goals =

The goal of gwt-touch is to provide a _pure_ GWT library for building mobile and touch-based web applications. Also, to prove that *web applications are a viable alternative to native applications*.

= Core Library =

To acheive a "native feel", gwt-touch _must_ flawless implement a core set of functionality that includes:
 * Scrolling & Touch - must be perfect, no delay, must _feel_ like a native application
 * Lists - must render fast, no delay when scrolling
 * Screen Transitions - much be flawless, no delay, no flickering

We will obsess over every pixel, every touch, every line of code until we get this core functionality working perfectly.

= Widget Toolkit =

In addition to the core functionality, gwt-touch includes a UI widget library. This will provide a number of common widgets and styles to help get you started.

Our goal is to not replicate _every_ widget in iOS or on Android. We give you the building blocks, but feel free to harness the full power of GWT, HTML and CSS to customize your application as you see fit.

= Compatibility =

Initially we will support the iPad. Hopefully when I get my honeycomb tablet at IO 2011 (hint hint google!) I will have a device to test on ... the emulator is unusable on my computer.
